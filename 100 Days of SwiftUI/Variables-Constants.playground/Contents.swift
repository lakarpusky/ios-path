// === How to create variables and constants === //

// .. when you make a value, you can chenge it over time
var name = "if3"
name = "gabo"
name = "lakar"

// .. if you dont ever want to chage a value, you need to use a "constant" instead
let character = "ragnar"
// character = "floki" // Note: change "let" to "var" to make it mutable

// .. while learning you can print the value of any variable
var playerName = "floki"
print(playerName)

playerName = "ubbe"
print(playerName)

playerName = "bjorn";
print(playerName);
